    This website doesn’t use cookies, in fact we don’t use any techniques for tracking our website visitors. We don’t
    ask for your consent to use cookies because we don’t use cookies. We don’t have an annoying cookie banner, because
    no one wants that. We do have website analytics, that help us understand what pages people are looking at. These
    analytics don’t require tracking people, so we don’t.
