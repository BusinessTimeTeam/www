    This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data in accordance with the UK General
    Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018.

  <p>MayorTech Limited is registered with the ICO with registration reference <strong>ZB205306</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Our Services</h2>

  <p>
    We provide software engineering, digital design, and project management consultancy services. In providing these
    services, we aim to minimise the processing of personal data wherever possible. Often, the data we work with is
    anonymised, aggregated, or relates to business entities rather than individuals.
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Process (and Why)</h2>

  <p>
    We may process the following types of personal data, only when necessary for the provision of our services or to
    comply with legal obligations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Client Data:</strong> This may include contact details (name, email address, phone number, job title) of
      individuals at client organisations that we interact with for project management, communication, and service
      delivery. The legal basis for processing this data is typically contractual necessity (to fulfil our obligations
      to the client) or legitimate interests (to manage our client relationships effectively).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Supplier Data:</strong> Similar to client data, we may process contact details of individuals at supplier
      organisations for procurement and service management purposes. The legal basis for this is usually contractual
      necessity or legitimate interests.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enquiries:</strong> If you contact us with an enquiry, we may collect your contact details and the content
      of your enquiry to respond to you. The legal basis for this processing is your consent or our legitimate interest
      in responding to your enquiry.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>

  <p>We will only share your personal data with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Legal authorities:</strong> We may disclose personal data if required by law or legal process.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>

  <p>
    We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised
    access, use, or disclosure. The exact details will vary depending on the work we do for you, you should consult your
    contract, or get in touch.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we are processing your data because you made an enquiry then we will store your enquiry data in our Google
    Workspace systems. You can learn more about the security techniques they use on the Google Workspace website.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>

  <p>
    We retain personal data only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, taking into
    account legal and regulatory obligations. As with data security, the exact details will vary depending on the work
    we do for you, you should consult your contract or get in touch.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we are processing your personal data because you made an enquiry, then your email and contact details will stay
    in our systems for 6 years, after which it will be automatically deleted.
